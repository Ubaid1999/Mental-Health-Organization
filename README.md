This website is going to be a management system to keep records of staff and patients of a mental health institute to minimize difficulties and stress of mental health patients trying to seek help for their issues and to lessen the hassle of specialists trying to maintain their pateint‚Äôs data. It also facilitates the management of the institute by reducing the unnecessary, albeit large amount of paperwork for storing, updating and managing the data of staff and patients. This is a platform where qualified mental health specialists can manage their appointments,track patients performance and view the feedback they receive to improve their interaction with the patients. Moreover, this platform is utilized by patients to register, keep an eye on their progress, view payments, and connect with other patients for emotional and moral support.
